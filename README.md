# Feature Engineering Techniques

Welcome to the Feature Engineering Techniques repository! This repository contains separate Jupyter Notebook files for various feature engineering techniques, including missing value handling, encoding, transformation, imbalanced dataset, and outlier detection. Each notebook provides practical examples of methods for handling the corresponding problem.

**Note:** Please keep in mind that the methods demonstrated in the notebooks are not an exhaustive list of all possible feature engineering techniques. There are many other techniques that can be used depending on the dataset and the problem at hand. I will keep updating this GitHub repository with new methods over time, so stay tuned for updates!

## Contents

- `01-Missing-Value-Handling.ipynb`: This notebook explores different methods for handling missing values, including mean imputation, median imputation, and multiple imputation.
- `02-Encoding.ipynb`: This notebook covers various encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.
- `03-Transformation.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates feature transformation techniques, including scaling, normalization, and log transformation.
- `04-Imbalanced-Dataset.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, such as random oversampling, random undersampling, and SMOTE.
- `05-Outlier-Detection.ipynb`: This notebook explores methods for detecting outliers, including z-score, IQR, and DBSCAN.
